## What if it were good tho?

Have you considered... what if it were good tho?

A remarkable amount of products are released without anyone ever considering this question, in regard to most aspects of the product. See [this rant about how almost nothing is actually designed](https://twitter.com/Malcolm_Ocean/status/1368295691185909764).

I have taken the time to consider, for several things, "what if it were good tho?"

This site is an ongoing index of what I imagine things would be like if they were good.

### Other epic reimaginings, not by Malcolm

1. Max Krieger: What if chat were good though? "can we augment our online chats with new affordances? what does a conversational medium that supports *thinking* look like? Is there a pathway from the linear, one-dimensional, immutable logs we call "online conversation"?" [I made a comic](https://a9.io/glue-comic/)
2. Bret Victor: What if coding were good though? "creators need to be able to see what they're doing". here's a [video](https://www.programmingtalks.org/talk/inventing-on-principle), though he has many other resources.
